# Music Player

### Introduction
This is a frontend Music Player app that enables users to upload their favourite MP3 files to the app and play them. The app also features artwork from the relevant tracks that is featured in a rotating disc animation on the screen.

To avoid any copyright infringement, the MP3 files of the chosen tracks do not actually work on this app, but the programming demonstrates the capabilities of the app nonetheless!
